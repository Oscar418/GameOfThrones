#  Game of Thrones kata

This Game of Thrones app I created for a Dicovery interview demostrating the usage of MVVM, all it does is show details about characters of GOT with the data coming from a json file. This was using Swift 3, so its not really supported in xcode 10.2.1, you might need to downgrade to 10.1.
